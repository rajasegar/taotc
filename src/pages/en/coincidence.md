### The Invevitability of unlikely events

![AM 386](/images/Am386DX-40.jpg)

We tend to stumble when estimating probabilities.

If someone says never, I usually register this as a minuscule probability 
greater than zero, since never cannot be compensated by a negative probability.

Improbable coincidences are precisely that: rare but very possible events.
It's not surprising when they finally happen.

What would be more surprising would be if they never came to be.
