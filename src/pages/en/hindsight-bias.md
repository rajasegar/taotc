### Why You should keep a diary?

![Diary](/images/diary.jpg)

In retrospect, everything seems clear and inevitable

We can aptly describe it as the "I told you so" phenomenon

The hindsight bias is one of the most prevailing fallacies of all.

So why the hindsight bias so perilous? Well, it makes us believe we 
are better predictors than we actually are, causing us to be arrogant 
about our knowledge and consequently to take too much risk.

Overcoming the hindsight bias is not easy. Studies have shown that people
who are aware of it fall for it just as much as everyone else.

Keep a journal.
Write down your predictions
Then from time to time, compare your notes with actual developments.
You will be amazed at what a poor forecaster you are. 
Dont' forget to read history too.

Hindsight may provide temporary comfort to those overwhelmed by complexity, but
as for providing deeper revelations about how the world works. you'll benefit
by looking elsewhere.
