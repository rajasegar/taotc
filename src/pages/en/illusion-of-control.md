### You control less than you think

![Dice](/images/dice.jpg)


The illusion of control is the tendency to believe that we can influence something over which we have absolutely no sway. 

And you? Do you have everything under control? 
Probably less than you think. 
Therefore, focus on the few things of importance that you can really influence. 
For everything else: que sera, sera.
