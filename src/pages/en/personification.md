### Why you prefer Novels to Statistics

Statistics don't stir us, people do.

![Jean Goujon, The Four Seasons, reliefs on the HÃ´tel Carnavalet, Paris, c. 1550s.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Goujon%2C_les_quatre_saisons_02.JPG/440px-Goujon%2C_les_quatre_saisons_02.JPG)

### Theory of mind
For aeons, groups have been essential to our survival. Thus, over the past 100,000 years, 
weh have developed an impressive sense of how others think and feel. Science calls this,
the 'theory of mind'.


Be careful when you encounter human stories. Ask for the facts and the statistical distribution
behind them. You can still be moved by the story, but this way, you can put it into the right context.
If, however, you seek to move and motivate people for your own ends, make sure your tale is seasoned with names and faces.
