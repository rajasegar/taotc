### Don't Accept Free Drinks

![Concorde](/images/peer-pressure.jpg)

People have extreme difficulty being in another person's debt.

It is also an ancient technique. We find reciprocity in all species whose food supplies 
are subject to high fluctuations.

### Good Side

Reciprocity is a very useful `survival strategy`, a form of risk managment. Without it,
humanity - and countless species of animal - would be long extinct. It is at the core of
cooperation between people who are not related to each other and a necessary ingredient for
economic growth and wealth creation. There would be no global economy without it - there
would be no economy at all. That's the good side of reciprocity.

### Ugly side
But there is also an ugly side of reciprocit: retaliation.
Revenge breeds counter-revenge and you soon find yourself in a full-scale war.
So compelling is the pull of reciprocity even when the stakes are far less high.
