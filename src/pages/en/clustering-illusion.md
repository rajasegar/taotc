### Why you see Shapes in the Clouds?

Over-sensitive pattern recognition

![Virgin mary toast](/images/virgin-mary-toast.jpeg)

The human brain seeks patterns and rules. In fact, it takes it one step further:
if it finds no familiar pattern, it simply invents some. The more diffuse the signal,
it is easier to find 'hidden messages' in it.

When it comes to pattern recognition, we are over-sensitive.
Regain your scepticism.
If you think you have discovered a pattern, first consider it pure chance.
