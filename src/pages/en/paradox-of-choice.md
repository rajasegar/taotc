### Less is more

![Choices](/images/choices.jpg)

Selection is the yardstick of progress.

It is what sets us apart from the planned econonmies and the Stone Age.
Yes, abundance makes you giddy, but there is a limit.
When it is exceeded a surfeit of choices destroys the quality of life.

A large selection leads to inner paralysis.
A broader selection leads to poorer decisions.

The stress caused by mind-boggling variety is so large

Large selection leads to discontent.

The more choice you have, the more unsure and therefore dissatisfied you are afterward.

### How to avoid
Think carefully before what you want before you inspect existing offers.
Write down these criteria and stick to the rigidly.
Also realise that you can never make a perfect decision.
Aiming for this, given the flood of possibilities, is a form of irrational perfectionism.
Instead learn to love a good choice.

Good enough is the new optimum.
