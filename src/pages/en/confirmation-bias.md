### Beware the Special Case

![Concorde](/images/confirmation-bias.jpg)

The confirmation bias is the mother of all misconceptions.

It is the tendency to interpret new information so that it becomes 
compatible with our existing theories, beliefs and convictions.
In other words, we filter out any new information that contradicts our
existing views (disconfirming evidence). This is a dangerous practice.
