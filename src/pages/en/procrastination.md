### Why New Year's Resolutions Don't work

![New Year Resolutions](/images/new-year-resolution.jpg)

Procrastination is the tendency to delay unpleasant but important acts. 

Procrastination is idiotic because no project completes itself. 
We know that these tasks are beneficial, so why do we keep pushing them on to the back burner? 
Because of the time lapse between sowing and reaping. 
To bridge it requires a high degree of mental energy.

The period of self-control had drained their mental energy – or willpower – which they now needed to solve the problem. 
Willpower is like a battery, at least in the short term. If it is depleted, future challenges will falter.

This is a fundamental insight. Self-control is not available around the clock. 
It needs time to refuel. 
The good news: to achieve this, all you need to do is refill your blood sugar and kick back and relax.

So get over yourself. Procrastination is irrational, but human. 
To fight it, use a combined approach.
