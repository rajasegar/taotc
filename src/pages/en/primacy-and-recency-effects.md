### How Eye Catching Details Render us Blind

![Salience](/images/salience.jpg)

The salience effect influences not only how we interpret the past, but also how we imagine the future. 

We place unwarranted emphasis on salient information when we are forecasting. 

This explains why investors are more sensitive to sensational news (i.e. the dismissal of a CEO) 
than they are to less striking information (such as the long-term growth of a companyâ€™s profits). 
Even professional analysts cannot always evade the salience effect.

Salient information has an undue influence on how you think and act. 
We tend to neglect hidden, slow-to-develop, discrete factors. 
Do not be blinded by irregularities. 

Gather enough mental energy to fight against seemingly obvious explanations.
