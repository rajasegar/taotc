### Don't take News Anchors seriously

![News Anchor](/images/news-anchor.jpg)

Two types of knowledge:
- Real knowledge
- Chauffeur knowledge

Knowledge from people who have learned to put on a show

Maybe they have a great voice or good hair, but the knowledge they espouse is not their own.
They reel off eloquent words as if reading from a script.

Unfortunately, it is increasingly difficult to separate true knowledge from chauffeur knowledge.
They make a serious effort to understand the complexity of a subject and to communicate it.
