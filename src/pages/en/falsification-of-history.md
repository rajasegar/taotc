### You were right all along

![memories](/images/memories.jpg)

By subconsciously adjusting past views to fit present ones, we avoid any embarrassing proof of our fallibility. 
It’s a clever coping strategy, because no matter how tough we are, admitting mistakes is an emotionally difficult task. 
But this is preposterous. 

Shouldn’t we let out a whoop of joy every time we realise we are wrong? 
After all, such admissions would ensure we will never make the same mistake twice and have essentially taken a step forward. 
But we do not see it that way.


It is safe to assume that half of what you remember is wrong. 
Our memories are riddled with inaccuracies, including the seemingly flawless flashbulb memories. 
Our faith in them can be harmless – or lethal. 

Consider the widespread use of eyewitness testimony and police line-ups to identify criminals. 
To trust such accounts without additional investigation is reckless, 
even if the witnesses are adamant that they would easily recognise the perpetrator again.
