### Why we prefer a wrong map to no map at all

![Map](/images/map.jpg)

We prefer wrong information to no information.

We create a picture of the world using the example that most easily come to mind.
This is absurd, of course, because in reality things don't happen more frequently just
because we can conceive of them more easily.

Thanks to availability bias, we travel through life with an incorrect risk map in our heads.
