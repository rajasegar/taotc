### Decide Better Decide Less

Intensive decision making will drain your willpower

Making decisions is exhausting. Anyone who has ever configured a laptop online or researched a long trip – flight, hotels, activities, restaurants, weather – knows this well: after all the comparing, considering and choosing, you are exhausted. Science calls this decision fatigue.


Decision fatigue is perilous: as a consumer, you become more susceptible to advertising messages and impulse buys. 
As a decision-maker, you are more prone to erotic seduction. 

Willpower is like a battery. After a while it runs out and needs to be recharged. 
How do you do this? By taking a break, relaxing and eating something. 
Willpower plummets to zero if your blood sugar falls too low.
