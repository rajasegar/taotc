### Don't Bow to Authority

![Pilot](/images/pilot.jpg)

Authorities pose two main problems to clear thinking: first, their track records
are often sobering.

Never has a group of experts failed so spectacularly.

Authorities crave recognition and constantly find ways to reinforce their status.

Authorities changes much life fashion does, and society follows it as much.

Whenever you are about to make a decision, think about which authority figures might 
be exerting an influence on your reasoning. And when you encounter one in the flesh,
do your best to challenge him or her.
