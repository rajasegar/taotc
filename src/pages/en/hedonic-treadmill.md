## Be Careful What you wish for

People who change or progress in their careers are,
in terms of happiness, right back where they started after around three months. 
The same goes for people who buy the latest Porsche. 
Science calls this effect the hedonic treadmill: we work hard, advance and are able to afford more and nicer things, and yet this doesn’t make us any happier.


### Affective forecasting
Our inability to correctly predict our own emotions.

So how do negative events affect us – say, a spinal cord injury or the loss of a friend? 
Here, we also overestimate the duration and intensity of future emotions. 

For example, when a relationship ends it feels like life will never be the same. The afflicted are completely convinced that they will never again experience joy, but after three or so months they are back on the dating scene.

Use these scientifically rubber-stamped pointers to make better, brighter decisions: 

1) Avoid negative things that you cannot grow accustomed to, such as commuting, noise or chronic stress. 

2) Expect only short-term happiness from material things, such as cars, houses, lottery winnings, bonuses and prizes. 

3) Aim for as much free time and autonomy as possible, since long-lasting positive effects generally come from what you actively do. Follow your passions even if you must forfeit a portion of your income for them. Invest in friendships. For most people, professional status achieves long-lasting happiness, as long as they don’t change peer groups at the same time.
