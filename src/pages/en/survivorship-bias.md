In daily life, because triumph is made more visible than failure, you systematically over-estimate
your chances of succeeding. As an outsider, you succumb to an illusion, and you mistake how minuscule
the probability of success really is.


The media is not interested in digging around in the graveyards of the unsuccessful. Nor is this its job.
To elude the `survivorship bias`, you must do the digging yourself.


You will also come across `survivorship bias` when dealing with money and risk.
