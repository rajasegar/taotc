### The Myth of Like-Mindedness

![global warming](/images/global-warming.jpg)

We frequently overestimate unanimity with others, believing that everyone else thinks and feels exactly like we do. 
This fallacy is called the false-consensus effect.

Assume that your worldview is not borne by the public. 
More than that: do not assume that those who think differently are idiots. 
Before you distrust them, question your own assumptions.
